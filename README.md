## Identify 1 issue of the current live website and resolve it in your design.

- The full screen of an image preview doesn't work if web app opened on mobile, fixed it.
- You can't move images while on full screen preview, fixed it.
- I believe, the size was taking a lot of space for mobile -> so implemented a dropdown instead.
- Fixed the design inconsistencies between the tables shown in Size&Guide and Shipping&Returns sections.

## Identify 3 performance issues of the current live website and describe, in writing, what they are and how you would address & fix them.

I have observed the product page and found some perfomannce issues which can be painful while scaling our product lines and overall the company size

- We can separate out the type of data in separate API calls - this would help us gauge and size our services better (specially if we follow microservices.) - I have shown in the Node JS app how can we separate images, product meta data, variants etc.
- I could see that the products are yet not working with identifiers in the url but with a name of the article - this could generate duplicate urls for different articles as we scale so we should move to the product ids/ some kind of SKU etc,
- The categories/product type are not scalable enough as they directly contain a type so if we in future switch to a multi tenancy category level, we'll have to look for some coded tree type structures for categories.

## If you could improve one thing about FINESSE right now - as you experience it - what would it be and why?

As FINESSE goal states it's a fast fashion brand for Gen-Z, I would like to give the consumer a power to design their own stuff or modify existing designs with something relatively new, share it with the community (like a social media layer on top of the ecommerce) and once some x number people votes up or ready to order, we publish it on our website with them as some kind of partners.

## Your plane crashes and you land on an island. What do you do? How do you plan your survival?

I would do these things if I am not much affected physically :

- Find out how many people survive the crash with me,
- Find out if I need a first aid and then provide it to others,
- Find out if my phone network is working and if I am able to send a message for the help.
- Find out if I can use the radio from the plane's cockpit to communicate for a SOS message.
- Find out if there's any other human being/ building on the island.
- Find out if I have some food and water left, and based on the existing people, already plan for rationing it.
- Will use some bright colored clothes to write a SOS message which can be seen from another plane passing by if there's a rescue operation in place.
- Find out if I can use something to blast during the evening/night time so that if anyone's around on a plane/ship, they can see me.
- Create a shelter based on the the number of people to sleep in the night time and try to ignite a fire so that no dangerous animals come around while sleeping.
- Will follow these steps every day until I am rescued.

## What matters to you most and why?

Career-wise I would say the most important for me right now in my new job is to have challenges which would help me grind myself and learn as much as I can because I believe I am still quite young to learn a lot of stuff happening in the engineering world. I would want to handle stuff from scratch so that when it's my time to solve a bigger problem, I would be knowing the processes and thinking hats around it.

If it's a personal question, the most that matters is my family as they have been besides me throughout and they have enabled me to reach where I am today. I would eventually like to stay close to my family when they need me the most in future (probably not right now as they're capable of handling things indenpendently for now)
